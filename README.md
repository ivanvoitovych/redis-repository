By submitting a Pull Request, you disallow any rights or claims to any changes submitted to the Viewi project and assign the copyright of those changes to Ivan Voitovych.

If you cannot or do not want to reassign those rights (your employment contract for your employer may not allow this), you should not submit a PR. Open an issue, and someone else can do the work.

This is a legal way of saying, "If you submit a PR to us, that code becomes ours." 99.9% of the time, that's what you intend anyways; we hope it doesn't scare you away from contributing.
